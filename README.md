# Auth0 + Ionic + Firebase


In order to run the project, you need to have `node`, `ionic`, `cordova` and `ios-sim` installed.
Once you have that, just clone the project and run the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `ionic build ios` || `ionic build android`
3. `ionic emulate ios` ||  `ionic emulate android`
